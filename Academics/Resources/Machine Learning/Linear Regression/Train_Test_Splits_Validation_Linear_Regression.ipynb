2\n","\n","As discussed in the lecture, a significant challenge, particularly when dealing with data that have many columns, is ensuring each column gets encoded correctly. \n","\n","This is particularly true with data columns that are ordered categoricals (ordinals) vs unordered categoricals. Unordered categoricals should be one-hot encoded, however this can significantly increase the number of features and creates features that are highly correlated with each other.\n","\n","Determine how many total features would be present, relative to what currently exists, if all string (object) features are one-hot encoded.
