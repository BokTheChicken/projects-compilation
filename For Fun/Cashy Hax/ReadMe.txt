Scam the scammers HAHAHA!

Cashy is a messenger bot that requires the user to solve arithmetic problems in order to gain a small amount of money (CENTS LITERALLY!) but in order to have this service
you must first register which requires a payment of 300 pesos. There is also a required amount of points in order to cashout the money you've gained by solving.

Me and my friends created a headless bot on raspberry pi that will automatically solve arithmetic problems and we are able to gain money instead of getting scammed.
